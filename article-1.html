                <p>In a world where trends are changing and fast fashion is the norm, the concept of a capsule wardrobe offers a fresh approach that is sustainable and minimalist. A capsule wardrobe consists of a limited selection of carefully curated pieces that are timeless and versatile and allow you to mix and match to create a variety of different outfits with just a small selection of clothes and accessories that will never go out of style.
                    <br><br>
                    Building your capsule wardrobe from scratch can be overwhelming, but don’t worry — we're here to guide you with the basics on how to create your brand-new wardrobe that is uniquely yours. 
                </p>
                <div class="content">
					<h1>Step 1: Assess Your Current Wardrobe</h1>
                <p>The first step before you create your new capsule wardrobe is to do an audit of your closet and go through every piece you own. While doing so, ask yourself: When was the last time I wore this? Do I see myself wearing this in the near future? If not, then it won’t be a great idea to add that to your capsule wardrobe.

					<h1>Step 2: Defining Your Color Palette</h1>
                <p>Having a mix of neutrals like black, gray, white, cream, and navy – added by a few bold and bright colors that best suit you will ensure endless outfit possibilities. Oh, and don’t forget gold or silver jewelry! It can be either of the two depending on your preference… but you can definitely mix metals if you want to be unique.</p>

                <p>
                    Having a capsule wardrobe promotes the importance of quality over quantity and being mindful with our consumption. We also can’t stress enough how important it is that you focus with what you already own instead of starting from scratch because that wouldn’t be sustainable at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We hope that this article inspires you to start creating your capsule wardrobe! The possibilities are endless — enjoy and have fun!
