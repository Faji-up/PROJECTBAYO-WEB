Project ✿ Bayo
2.0 About
Founded by Alegra Zagala, Project Bayo was created through her love and passion for fashion and style, and it was only been recently that Alegra started to shift into the sustainable route and became a conscious consumer. Aware of the dangers and negative effects of the fast fashion industry, Alegra was inspired to change her ways by investing in classic, timeless pieces, supporting local sustainable brands, and giving light and love to her old clothes by styling them in her own unique way.


Project Bayo hopes to inspire and educate others to become agents of change in the fashion industry through ethical and sustainable consumerism, and show that you can look good and feel good while also helping our planet.
