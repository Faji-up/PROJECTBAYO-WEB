				<h1>A Beginner’s Guide To Sustainable Fashion</h1>
				<img src="images/Fashion/images/ARTICLE 3/flats.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Sustainable fashion has become a growing movement in the clothing industry, which aims to reduce the ecological footprint of clothing production and promote social responsibility in today’s world where fast fashion is the norm.
					<br>
					<br>
					At its core, sustainable fashion seeks to create clothing by minimizing waste, reducing energy consumption, and using eco-friendly and biodegradable materials such as organic cotton, wool, and linen among many others which are harvested without harmful chemicals and pesticides — while also ensuring that the supply chain is ethical wherein garment workers are paid fairly and work under a safe and humane environment.

				<div class="content">
					<h2>1. Circular Fashion</h2>
					<p>Circular fashion revolves around the system of minimizing waste and maximizing resources, to ensure that clothes, shoes, and accessories can circulate responsibly for as long as possible.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>2. Zero Waste</h2>
					<p>This refers to minimizing waste throughout the life cycle of a garment from production to disposal, such as using biodegradable materials instead of waste as well as encouraging consumers to recycle or upcycle their old garments instead of throwing them away.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<h2>3. Upcycling and Recycling</h2>
					<p>Upcycling involves using existing materials or clothing and repurposing them into something new and unique, such as transforming an old dress into a top and a skirt. On the other hand, recycling is done by breaking down materials to create new products.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>4. Eco-friendly, Slow Fashion Brands</h2>
					<p>These brands specialize in ethical and sustainable fashion by using natural and organic materials and being transparent with their supply chains and fair trade practices.
						<br>
						<br>
						In conclusion, we consumers have the power to impact the fashion industry and environment significantly by choosing to support sustainable fashion in order to work towards building a sustainable future and help reduce the environmental footprint that will not only benefit the fashion industry but also our society and planet in the long run.
